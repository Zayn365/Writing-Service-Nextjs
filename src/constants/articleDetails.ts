The word count is an estimate but can be discussed with me by the author, with the aim of improving the quality of the book. Because it should not be a hindering factor for quality. Other suggestions can be made and I'm open to discussing things. I trust that you will find me a good and experienced writer on this subject. This is my first project and I am currently taking a course for it. The reason I chose your service is because of the service of adding the right number of photos in combination with a full package service. If there is a need to add premium photos, I trust you will discuss that with the goal of creating the best book. If there are any questions, please contact me." },
